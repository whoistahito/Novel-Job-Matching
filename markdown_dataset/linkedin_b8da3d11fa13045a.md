* Excellent problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
* Ability to work independently and as part of a team.
* Strong communication skills.
**Preferred Qualifications**
* Experience with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
* Familiarity with Agile development methodologies.
* Experience with testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit).
**What’s in it for you?**As well as a competitive salary and annual leave allowance, our benefits include health insurance, skills training and much more, depending on the location. We also offer a host of softer benefits, including many social events throughout the year such as summer and winter holiday parties, monthly team building events, sports tournaments, charity days and wellbeing activities.
The base salary range for this role is $145,000 - $200,000. There are a number of factors which affect what the specific pay offer would be for this role, including location, seniority, and relevant educational and working experience.
