**About Corgi**At **Corgi**, we're building the first fully automated insurance carrier. Our goal is to rebuild the $1T+ insurance industry from the ground up using AI. We're not just building a company; we're building infrastructure for the next hundred years. If you’ve built things from scratch and know what it means to grind (we’re talking 7 days in the office), we want you on the team.
We’re well-funded and backed by top investors. We don’t care about traditional roles or titles—just that you’re smart, proactive, and bring the same founder-level ownership and drive to help us build something massive.
This is not going to be your typical software engineering role, we are hardcore and moving fast. This is a role for someone who wants to reimagine an industry using their technical abilities. You will be given a large amount of agency as well as responsibility, and can expect to grow a lot. We want people who are looking to build something huge while having a great time with friends.
**What You'll Do**As a **Full Stack Software Engineer**, you will:
* Build complex browser automations
* Build systems to enable our claims process with automation from the ground up
* Add AI integrations to existing processes
* Create AI agents to handle simple to advanced tasks
* Help us ship new product offerings and iterate on them quickly
**What We’re Looking For**
* You have experience with shipping and maintaining code to real customers
* Can operate and adapt quickly under changing circumstances
* Experience with Typescript, Python, React, Go
* Willing and able to do frontend and backend
* Experience with SQL databases and maintaining them in production
* Deployment experience on AWS or similar
* Examples of AI automations you have made
* Created browser automations using tools like Playwright, Stagehand, Computer Use, etc.
* Live projects that we can check out
* You move fast, prioritize efficiency, and get things done
**Why You Should Join**
* Founder Mentality: We value extreme ownership and want people who think like founders—fast decision makers, natural problem solvers, and executers.
* Ground Floor Opportunity: You’ll be helping to shape and grow a revolutionary company with the resources to back it.
* Impact & Speed: Work in a fast-paced environment where your contributions will have immediate, tangible effects on the company’s success.
**Still Interested?**Reach out, we would love to chat!
Let’s build something massive together.
