**About Exeon:**
Exeon Analytics AG is a Swiss cyber tech company specialising in the protection of IT and OT networks through AI-driven security analytics. Our Network Detection & Response (NDR) platform ExeonTrace allows companies to monitor corporate networks, immediately detect cyber threats and thus effectively protect their organisation’s IT landscape - quickly, reliably, and completely hardware-free. The self-learning algorithms for detecting anomalies in network activity were developed at ETH Zurich and are based on more than ten years of academic research. Exeon was awarded as one of the top three high-tech companies at the SEF 2021 and consists of an interdisciplinary team of data scientists, machine learning experts, white hat hackers, network security specialists and business professionals. Exeon is determined to become the leading NDR provider in Europe and already counts renowned companies such as PostFinance, Planzer and SWISS Airlines among its customers.

As a Principal Front-end Engineer at Exeon, you will be working with a small cross-functional team consisting of back-end developers, front-end engineers and quality assurance engineers on data heavy single page applications that are used by enterprise customers to analyze network traffic and discern potential security risks based on the data input. This data is rendered as tables and graphs, etc.
Your role will be to build out the front-end alongside our front-end engineers, whilst also helping shape the overall UI and UX of the product and help bring it to the next level with regards to appearance and functionality.
**What you can expect from us:**

* A young, diverse and dynamic team of tech and business professionals
* A competitive salary and appealing benefits package
* Lots of fun, exciting interactions and new challenges.
**We are looking for:**
* A front-end enthusiast who likes bringing the front-end to the next level, finding pragmatic solutions, working in a cross-functional team and staying up to date with front-end technologies.
* A professional who has at least 7 years of experience as front-end engineer and at least a bachelor’s degree in computer science/software engineering (or similar).
* A front-end architect who shapes and improves the architecture and design of the product, ensuring a well-thought-through technical foundation.
* A technical expert who optimizes the code/application for the best performance and advocating for state-of-the-art technologies and engineering practices.
* A mentor and guide to the front-end team who supports team members in their professional growth.
* End-to-end ownership through the software lifecycle with a strong focus on solution, code quality, and efficiency.

* Prior experience writing React functional components using React hooks to enhance them with Lifecyle, state and side effects.
* Experience with creating data analytics frontends.
