          "success": false,
          "reason": "The output correctly extracts many explicit skills (vanilla JavaScript, semantic HTML5, CSS3, tooling, etc.) and experiences (React.js experience, Web‑Browser ecosystem knowledge, fast‑paced environment) with no hallucinations, showing good adherence to steps 3 and 4. However, it leaves the qualifications list empty, missing clear qualifications such as the senior level requirement, English language proficiency, and the bonus items (e.g., video infrastructure, Node.js, Firebase, Astro). This omission means not all requirements were captured (step 2) and the categorization is incomplete (step 5)."

However, it omits the mandatory requirement to know or be eager to learn new frameworks such as Astro, so coverage of required qualifications is incomplete, resulting in a high but not perfect score."

          "success": false,
          "reason": "The JSON correctly separates items into 'skills', 'experiences', and 'qualifications' and is well‑structured, meeting the organization/readability step. However, several entries are mis‑categorized (e.g., 'high attention to detail' and 'highest level of quality' appear under skills, while soft‑skill statements like 'Ability to work in a fast‑paced environment' are under experiences). Some requirements are overly verbose or vague, such as 'In-Depth, thorough, and up-to-date knowledge of the Web‑ and Browser‑Ecosystem' and 'clean architectures', which reduces specificity and clarity. Additionally, the empty 'qualifications' array suggests missing or misplaced items. These issues lower the overall alignment with the evaluation criteria."
