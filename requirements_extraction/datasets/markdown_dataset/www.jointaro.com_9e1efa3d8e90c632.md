### Job Description
Our Company
Changing the world through digital experiences is what Adobe's all about. We give everyone—from emerging artists to global brands—everything they need to design and deliver exceptional digital experiences! We're passionate about empowering people to create beautiful and powerful images, videos, and apps, and transform how companies interact with customers across every screen.
We're on a mission to hire the very best and are committed to creating exceptional employee experiences where everyone is respected and has access to equal opportunity. We realize that new ideas can come from everywhere in the organization, and we know the next big idea could be yours!
THE OPPORTUNITY
Be part of the Adobe Cloud Platform & Collaboration (ACPC) and enable collaborative, cloud-centered workflows for creatives around the world. We lay the foundation of innovation and scale at Adobe.
ACPC is the cloud platform for Adobe Products, such as Photoshop, InDesign, Express, Fresco, Illustrator, XD, the Document Cloud, and more. We operate across multiple regions on Amazon Web Services (AWS). As a multi-functional, self-organizing development team member, you will architect, develop, deploy, and own internal and public Java services: "You build it, you run it!".
We are welcoming team-oriented colleagues who will work in an agile team and collaborate locally in Hamburg and with other, Adobe-minded teams in the USA and India. We encourage continuous learning and -improvement, seeking people who want to grow with us.
WHAT YOU WILL DO
* Together with your multi-functional team, you take end-to-end ownership for microservices that are central to the platform: Design, build, test, and operate
* Develop secure and resilient backend services, scaling for all Adobe customers
* Evolve the platform architecture to include current best practices
* Embracing high standards for code and the development process
* Promote a culture of continuous learning
* Work with Adobe client teams who build their applications using ACPCs APIs
* This position would also be possible as part-time (>= 60%)
YOUR SKILLS AND BACKGROUND
* Relevant Bachelor's/Master's degree or equivalent experience in a related field.
* Understanding of distributed and scalable cloud systems, ideally on AWS.
* Strong programming skills. Our main language is Java.
* Dedication to teamwork, self-organization, and continuous improvement.
* Proficiency in English, good knowledge or ability to learn German
ADDITIONAL SKILLS WHICH WOULD BE GREAT
* Working experience in building RESTful web services ideally based on the Spring framework.
* Comprehension of NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Cassandra operating with scale and reliability requirements
* Hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes
* Interest in monitoring, alerting, and analysis using tools like Splunk, New Relic, Prometheus, Grafana
* Curiosity about automation, analysis, and data engineering (using a variety of programming languages)
