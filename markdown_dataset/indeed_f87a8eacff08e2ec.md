Full job description
--------------------
* **Hi, We’re AppFolio.**
We’re innovators, changemakers, and collaborators. We’re more than just a software company — we’re a cloud-based powerhouse that creates products to make our customers’ lives easier. We’re revolutionizing how people do business, and we want your ideas, enthusiasm, and passion to help us keep innovating.
**Who we are looking for:**
AppFolio is looking for a Software Engineer II to join our fast-paced team working to bring the power of well-designed SaaS services to our Investment Manager product, the leading software platform in the fast-growing space of real estate investment management. We seek a strong software engineer to help build and evolve the foundational elements of our product. This industry is ripe for innovation and AppFolio Investment Manager is leading the way. The ideal candidate will thrive in a highly collaborative environment, applying Agile techniques toward building and evolving infrastructure and systems for cross-functional product development teams.
This is an ideal opportunity for someone who has a passion for building leading-edge software and is driven to help build a successful SaaS product used by thousands of happy businesses. We foster an environment that empowers small teams to set the technical direction of our solutions collaboratively.
**Responsibilities:**
+ Become a master of your software engineering craft, and work with other software engineers who are smart enough to teach you, and humble enough to learn from you.
+ Develop scalable, robust, and simple web-based solutions to solve complex business problems for our customers.
+ Implement new features and optimize existing ones to drive maximum scalability, stability, and performance.
+ Use test-driven development, code reviews, and continuous integration to deliver high-quality software and rapidly fix bugs as they come up.
+ Work closely with, and incorporate feedback from other engineering team members, QA, product owners, and our APM customers.
+ Leverage agile practices to release small batches of value to customers continuously. – test-driven development, pair programming, live code review, continuous integration, and continuous delivery.
**You know you’re the right fit if…**
+ You’ve heard of Ruby and Rails and have experience working with a language like Ruby, Java, or Python. You may even know enough about Javascript to have opinions about how frequently "the new hot thing" changes.
+ You love learning about new technologies but understand the value of using something old if it still does everything you need it to do.
+ You care about the long-term maintainability of the codebase and will learn to advocate for refactoring and clean-ups where appropriate.
+ You care about work-life balance and want your company to care about it, too; you'll put in the extra hour when needed but won't let it become a habit.
**Additional Skills and Knowledge:**
+ Bachelors, Masters, or Ph.D. in Computer Science or related technical discipline
+ At least 2 years of hands-on work experience developing web-based applications, preferably in a SaaS environment
+ Creativity, ability to solve complex problems without a roadmap
**Nice to Have:**
+ Experience working across all levels of the development stack
+ Experience with some areas of our tech like Ruby on Rails, React, MySQL, AWS, SOA
+ Familiarity with Agile software development processes: Scrum or Kanban
+ Familiarity with Test-Driven-Development
**Compensation & Benefits**
The base salary/hourly wage that we reasonably expect to pay for this role is: $114,400 -$143,000
The actual base salary/hourly wage for this role will be determined by a variety of factors, including but not limited to: the candidate’s skills, education, experience, etc.
Please note that base pay is one important aspect of a compelling Total Rewards package. The base pay range indicated here does not include any additional benefits or bonuses/commissions that you may be eligible for based on your role and/or employment type.
