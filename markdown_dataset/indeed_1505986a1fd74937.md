**About the role**
At Feather, we are making insurance honest, transparent, and simple. We do this by building products that are easy to use and understand, and they are being used by thousands of happy customers every day.
We are looking for a full-stack engineer to join our product team. In this role, you’ll be working alongside talented developers, product managers, and designers from around the world.
You will contribute across all of our technical stack — from frontend, to backend, to data and infrastructure — and help us launch new products throughout Europe.
**Why work at Feather?**
* **We’re small, lean, and we love what we do.** The usual buzzwords here, except we actually mean them. Staying small helps us focus on what matters, and we want to keep it that way.
* **A modern tech stack to work with.** We use TypeScript with NestJS, Prisma and React. Our CI/CD runs on GitHub actions, and the code is deployed to GCP with Docker and Terraform.
* **You’ll work on a product that is loved by customers.** Our excellent Trustpilot and Google reviews speak for themselves.
* **There’s plenty of space to grow.** We trust you to take ownership and make decisions from day one, and we will give you all the support and mentorship you need to succeed.
* **You’ll have the freedom to explore and innovate.** Our regular hack days let you experiment with new technologies and ideas. In fact, our design system Dirty Swan and several other internal tools were once a hack day project.
* **Unique company perks**. We offer a remote-first work environment, yearly education and home-office budgets, regular company retreats and dinners, and an option to take a sabbatical to recharge or pursue personal goals.
**What you’ll be doing?**
In 2025, we aim to expand our insurance products and customer base across the EU while keeping our team intentionally lean, focused and pragmatic.
In a nutshell, you will work on product features in a highly collaborative, small team. There will be lots of hands-on coding, but that’s only a part of the job. We expect you to contribute beyond the codebase, to get involved in shaping the projects on our roadmap, and to lead projects early on.
This role is full-stack, and you’ll face a wide variety of challenging problems that will push you to grow and excel. From day one, you’ll ship code to production, and over time, you’ll explore every corner of our product. Here’s a glimpse of what you’ll work on:
* Scale and optimize our React SPA, improving performance for daily users.
* Work on a signup flow builder to support rapid launches in new countries.
* Enhance UI/UX, accessibility, and our design system, Dirty Swan.
* Automate policy management backend jobs with Temporal.
* Collaborate across teams: data, marketing, customer support, and insurance.
* Introduce new payment methods to our Stripe-backed checkout screen.
* Manage our serverless GCP infra with Terraform and Docker.
* Experiment with low-code tools like customer.io, Tally and n8n.
* Develop robust REST APIs with NestJS, Prisma and PostgreSQL.
* Streamline the customer support work in a GraphQL/React admin panel.
* Propose architectural changes using our RFC process.
* Improve claims, notifications and auth in our iOS/Android Expo apps.
* Integrate out Next.js marketing website with a self-hosted Strapi CMS.
* Bring your own ideas to life during our regular hack days.
**Who are you?**
Above all, we value excellent communication and self-management. At Feather, you’ll be trusted with significant responsibility early on and will wear many hats. We’re looking for engineers with a strong product mindset who are comfortable diving into product work beyond just coding.
If you thrive in environments with a fair degree of uncertainty and enjoy shaping both the “what” and the “how” of building products, you’ll fit right in. But if you prefer a traditional setup where engineers focus solely on writing code while PMs handle the rest, Feather might not be the right place for you.
Of course, your tech skills are still most important, and here is the baseline:
* You’ve built full-stack applications with React and node.js, backed by a SQL database.
* You have an eye for design, care about accessibility and are comfortable contributing to our design system Dirty Swan.
* You can write clean, maintainable, and reusable code and make design decisions regarding the architecture.
* You have a good understanding of how modern codebases are maintained and deployed – containers, VMs, CI/CD, testing.
But that’s it. We don’t expect you to know everything about the latest hype architecture or framework that the internet is raving about. Quite the opposite—we would prefer someone curious but practical, who can pick the right, often boring, tool for the job.
We don’t care about degrees or formal years of experience as a software developer. We encourage people who switched to engineering late in their careers to join. If you enjoy the challenge and can learn fast, the team will provide you with every bit of support you need.
