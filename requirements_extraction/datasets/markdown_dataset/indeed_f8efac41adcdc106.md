Why N-able:
N-able, Inc. (NYSE: NABL) is a well-established and fast-growing company that provides cybersecurity solutions to Managed Service Providers (MSPs) through a powerful SaaS platform. We are a global company with N-Ablites in more than 15 countries around the world.
To support our growth in Europe, we are expanding our team of SDRs and are hiring driven, smart and coachable individuals.
As an SDR (Sales Development Representative) at N-Able, you'll help connect potential customers with the tools they need to protect and manage their clients' technology. This is a great opportunity for entry-level professionals to break into the tech industry, learn about cutting-edge cybersecurity solutions, and develop valuable sales skills in a supportive, fast-paced environment. You'll play a key role in driving growth while building a strong foundation for your career in tech sales!
This role is hybrid (minimum 3 days per week in our Utrecht office, and 2 days from home).
What You'll Do:
* Engage with potential new customers, mainly through cold calling but also by leveraging multiple channels such as emails and LinkedIn, to identify new opportunities and generate appointments for our sales team.
* Help our prospects understand N-Able’s value and how we can support their business.
* Work closely with Account Executives across Europe to ensure that the appointments you generate can progress down the sales funnel.
* Meet daily and weekly key activity metrics.
* Extensive use of CRM (Salesforce and Outreach) to maintain accurate activity, contact, and account information of all customers and prospects.
* Invest in your own development by following trainings, sharing best practices with your teammates, learning from all your colleagues including your manager and the Sales organisation.
What You'll Bring:
* Desire to work in a quickly growing industry and to achieve and exceed targets.
* Ability to demonstrate an aptitude for technology.
* Dutch native or C1 certification
* Drive to grow and thrive in a Tech Sales company.
* An inquisitive mind and a strong desire to understand our industry and customers.
* Great communication skills and an ability to interact and build rapport with individuals at all levels of an organization.
* Ability to manage your time effectively, work independently and be intrinsically motivated.
* Growth mindset - someone who is constantly looking to learn and better themselves.
* Past SaaS sales experience is a plus but is not essential. If you have the right attitude and a mind for sales, we can teach you everything you need to know to succeed.
**What to expect from us**
* A structured onboarding experience mixing learning, practice and coaching, to help you reach your targets.
* Strong support from the management team and the wider team to develop you and help you grow in your role.
* A defined career path, where you have the opportunity to progress into an Account Executive role at N-Able. Most of our Account Executives are hired from the SDR talent pool.
* A respectful management that values transparency, authenticity and open communication.
* A tight-knit, motivating and fun SDR team that pushes each other to achieve more together.
Purple Perks:
* Monthly stipend towards individual healthcare policy
* Generous PTO, sick leave and observed holidays
* 2 Paid VoluNteer Days per year
* Paid Parental Leave
* Employee Stock Purchase Program
* Pension with company-contribution
* FuN-raising opportunities as part of our giving program
