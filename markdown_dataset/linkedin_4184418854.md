### Gabriele Zirpoli
#### Founder & CEO at floatz | Helping life science investors make smarter bets with AI-powered scientific diligence
At **floatz**, we envision a world where every single person in the world feels inspired to create extraordinary things - because inspiration makes the impossible possible.
Yet, the outdated research system slows progress with paywalled knowledge, inefficient searches, and sluggish publishing.
As ETH Zurich PhDs, we’ve experienced these frustrations firsthand. That’s why we built **floatz** -an AI-powered platform to make research easier to find and faster to publish.
We’re at the start of something big. This is your chance to work on an industry-disrupting AI product that’s already gaining traction and building a loyal user base.

**About the role**
We’re looking for a Software Engineer to take the lead on building and refining our frontend. You’ll play a crucial role in bringing our AI-powered research platform to life, working directly with the founders.
We’re looking for someone who’s obsessed with building products that people love - an engineer who thrives in a fast-paced startup and is eager to make an impact.
You won’t just be writing code - you’ll be shaping how people interact with knowledge.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Who you are**
* Driven to build extraordinary things - you align with our mission and thrive in a fast-paced, high-impact environment.
* A team player with a positive attitude who values trust, respect, and mutual support.
* Excited to work in a small, agile team, taking on multiple roles and responsibilities.
* A proactive learner, eager for feedback and rapid growth.
* Someone who enjoys team bonding through activities and social events.
**Must-haves**
* **Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science** or a related technical field.
* Experience with **at least one** of the following programming languages: C, C++, Rust, Java.
* Experience with **at least one** of the following: JavaScript, Python, TypeScript.
* Strong understanding of data structures, algorithms, and software design principles.
**Nice-to-haves**
* **Master’s degree in Computer Science** or related field.
* Experience building products that users love.
* Knowledge of cloud environments and security best practices.
* A track record of successfully delivering complex projects.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Offer**

• Hybrid work in Zürich, Switzerland.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Before You Apply – A Word of Caution**
Joining floatz isn’t just a career move - it’s a leap into the unknown. Startups are tightrope walks over scarce resources. Flexibility isn’t a perk; it’s a necessity. Expect change. Embrace chaos. You’ll wear multiple hats, work long hours, and navigate uncertainty.
But in return? You’ll grow fast, make a lasting impact, and build something extraordinary.
Ready to take the plunge? Apply now and shape the future of research with us.
