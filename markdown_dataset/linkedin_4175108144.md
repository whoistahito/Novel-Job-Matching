**About us:**
Syndica is creating the Cloud of Web3. We supply the most critical applications in Web3 with enterprise-grade RPC infrastructure and developer tools tailored for the Solana ecosystem. Joining our team means you'll be held to a high standard, technically challenged, and grow close to a group of individuals passionate about building new infrastructure technologies.
We are backed by strategic partners, investors, and advisors who are all-in on our mission: Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital, Steve Jang of Kindred Ventures, Joe McCann of Asymmetric, Jump Crypto, Coinbase Ventures, Solana Ventures, Circle Ventures, and many more.
**About you:**
* You are a talented engineer who thrives in a collaborative and fast-paced environment.
* Have 3+ years of related professional experience using **Rust**
* Proven experience in learning new tools and applying that knowledge to maximize performance, safety, time to deliver, and overall quality of work.
* Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or relevant experience.
**Bonus Experience:**
* Knowledge in Go
* Proficient in web and network protocols (HTTP, TLS, DNS) and monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana).
* Strong understanding of database engines (PostgreSQL, Clickhouse) and cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure).
* Experienced with Kubernetes, Docker, and creating/maintaining CI/CD pipelines.
**About the role:**
You will be working with other engineers to design, implement, and maintain web services that process API requests at scale with a focus on reliability, performance, and metrics/observability.
The role’s responsibilities require an ability to pursue solutions to problems independent of explicit guidance and adjust those solutions based on feedback or changing circumstances.
**Key responsibilities:**
* **Code Contribution:** write high-quality web services and components in Rust that emphasize performance, reliability, maintainability, and readability.
* **Code Ownership:** design, implement, and maintain core web services and components with a drive to always improve and iterate towards the best practical solutions.
* **Core Reasoning:** draw on past experience, existing knowledge, research, and collaboration to avoid pitfalls and balance tradeoffs between solutions to maximize results.
* **Collaboration:** leverage strong communication skills to break down complex ideas into simple terms and demonstrate a knack for collaboration across a large group of engineers.
**What does success in this role look like?**
* In three months, you have become one of our core backend developers. You’ll have taken on independent code review responsibilities and are collaborating on the design of new features.
* In six months, you have earned the trust of the team and are delivering tasks through the entire SDLC, from design through development with minimal guidance, and are helping to effectively mentor new engineers joining the team.
* In twelve months, you have established a cadence of predictable, on-time delivery without cutting corners.
