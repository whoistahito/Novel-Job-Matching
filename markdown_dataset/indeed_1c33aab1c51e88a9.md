--------------------
AppFolio is more than a company. We’re a community of dreamers, big
thinkers, problem solvers, active listeners, and multipliers. At every
opportunity, we set the pace while delivering innovation built to carry
real estate into the future. One in which every experience feels
effortless, yet meaningful. Where customers are empowered to take on any
opportunity. We show up as one team, connected by our values to be a
force for good. Because together, we have the power to create
extraordinary outcomes for our customers, our communities, and
ourselves.
We are looking for a Senior Payments Software Engineer to play a key
role in our Payments Infrastructure development team. In this role, you
will contribute to the enhancement and maintenance of our platform,
ensuring it remains highly scalable and resilient. You will also
collaborate with our Customer Care team to resolve critical customer
issues, making a direct impact on our users.
This is an
excellent opportunity for a passionate engineer who thrives on working
with cutting-edge technology and is motivated to help build a successful
SaaS product used by thousands of businesses. Our team values
collaboration, innovation, and technical excellence, empowering small

**Your impact**
* Work with an engineering team to design, build, modernize, and
maintain our highly scalable payments platform.
* Integrate with our banking partners to enhance our platform and
incorporate analytics to help identify efficiencies and cost savings
opportunities.
* Analyze the impact of proposed architectural changes and work with
our risk and fraud teams to detect and investigate fraud across
AppFolio’s entire suite of products.
**Qualifications**
* You love learning about new technologies but understand the value of
continuing to use something old if it still does everything you need
it to do.
* You care about the long-term maintainability of the codebase and
will learn to advocate for refactoring and clean-ups where
appropriate.
* You care about work-life balance and want your company to care about
it, too; you'll put in the extra hour when needed but won't let it
become a habit.
**Must have**
* 5+ years of software engineering experience, with at least 3 of
those years spent working in a SaaS payments environment
* Experience building a payments system that processes billions of
dollars each year
* Understanding of payments system networks, including card systems,
ACH, and checking
* Experience in risk management and the compliance domain
* Proven experience with some areas of our tech like Ruby on Rails,
React, Redux, AWS, SOA
* Strong familiarity with Agile software development processes: Scrum
or Kanban
* Strong familiarity with Test-Driven-Development
* Experience building streaming systems with large amounts of data and
complex aggregation logic
* Experience working on a fraud detection and prevention system
