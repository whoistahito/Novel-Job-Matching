What you’ll do
We’re looking for Backend engineers who want to make an impact on managing money at a global scale with a passion for building ergonomic APIs. You’ll play a key role in extending our balance management platform and in building out a new funds accessibility platform leveraged by enterprises and SMBs alike. Our team collaborates with many cross-functional teams – from Infrastructure to Product – at Stripe to deliver innovative solutions that address evolving user needs.
**Responsibilities**
* Scope, design, build, and maintain APIs, services, and large-scale systems that reliably and efficiently handle billions of money movement requests
* Debug and solve critical production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack
* Mentor engineers to help them grow
* Collaborate with stakeholders across the company to build new features at large-scale, while improving internal engineering standards, tooling, and processes
* Collaborate effectively in a distributed and hybrid team, maintaining open communication and strong connections with colleagues
Who you are
We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.
**Minimum Requirements**
* 2-12+ years of industry software engineering experience (does not include internships nor includes co-ops)
* Strong coding skills in any programming language (we understand new languages can be learned on the job so our interview process is language agnostic)
* Strong collaboration skills, can work across workstreams within your team and contribute to your peers’ success
* Have the ability to thrive on a high level of autonomy, responsibility, and think of yourself as entrepreneurial
* Interest in working as a generalist across varying technologies and stacks to solve problems and delight both internal and external users
**Preferred Qualifications**
* Experience with large-scale financial tracking systems
* Good understanding and practical knowledge in cloud based services (e.g. gRPC, GraphQL, Docker/Kubernetes, cloud services such as AWS, etc.)
Hybrid work at Stripe
Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.
Pay and benefits
The annual US base salary range for this role is $150,500 - $281,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings ("OTE") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.
Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.
