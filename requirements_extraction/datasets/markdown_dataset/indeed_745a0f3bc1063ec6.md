CrowdBuilding is expanding, and we’re looking for a proactive and driven Business Development Representative (BDR) to help us engage all 342 municipalities and 12 provinces across the Netherlands. Your role will focus on reaching out to municipalities and provinces, introducing them to CrowdBuilding, and setting up calls and introductions for our founder.
In addition to outreach, you will build and activate a professional community of municipal and provincial staff, connecting them to each other through events, webinars, and knowledge-sharing initiatives. You will also be responsible for managing and optimising our outreach processes in HubSpot, ensuring we have effective flows, tracking, and reporting in place.
This is an ideal role for someone who enjoys building relationships, optimising sales tools, and facilitating connections — all while contributing to a socially and environmentally meaningful mission.
### **About CrowdBuilding**
At CrowdBuilding, we believe that the housing shortage can best be solved by residents themselves.
Our mission? To make the collective self-build movement bigger – first in the Netherlands, and eventually worldwide. Why? Because we believe that living can be fairer, more affordable, and above all, more fun. Building together not only strengthens social ties but also creates resilient neighbourhoods where people are truly there for each other.
We’re also committed to a healthy planet. By embracing and promoting circular and bio-based construction, we want to make environmentally friendly ways of building the norm.
We actively work with municipalities and provinces that want to make a social, climate, and financial impact. We’re guided by the principles of the Donut Economy, where the balance between social justice and sustainability leads the way.
### **Your Responsibilities**
* Identify, map, and prioritise outreach to all 342 municipalities and provinces, with a focus on understanding their specific housing and community development challenges.
* Conduct outreach via email, LinkedIn, phone, and events to introduce CrowdBuilding and set up introductory meetings for our founder.
* Set up and optimise HubSpot outreach flows to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our outreach efforts.
* Manage and maintain HubSpot, ensuring all outreach, follow-ups, and meetings are tracked correctly and that reporting is clear.
* Continuously analyse and optimise outreach processes, working to improve response rates and conversion into meetings.
* Collaborate with the team to develop and implement a community strategy aimed at connecting municipal and provincial professionals to each other, enabling them to share knowledge, best practices, and innovative ideas around collective self-build and sustainable housing.
* Organise and promote regular webinars, roundtables, and peer-to-peer learning events, tailored for municipal and provincial staff working on housing, sustainability, and community development.
* Work with the marketing team to create newsletters, case studies, and content highlighting innovative municipal projects and showcasing the potential of collective housing.
* Create opportunities for municipalities and provinces to connect, either through online forums, in-person networking sessions, or themed knowledge-sharing campaigns.
* Stay up to date with relevant housing policies, municipal initiatives, and trends, using this knowledge to spark conversations and uncover new collaboration opportunities.
* Represent CrowdBuilding at sector events, conferences, and networking sessions, both to expand our reach and to connect municipalities and provinces directly to each other.
### **What We’re Looking For**
* Experience in business development, outreach, sales operations, or community engagement, ideally in a public sector context.
* Hands-on experience with HubSpot (or similar tool) is essential — from setting up outreach flows to reporting and optimisation.
* Excellent communication skills in Dutch and English — both written and verbal.
* Confidence in reaching out to new contacts, building rapport, and securing meetings.
* Highly organised, with strong attention to detail — comfortable managing outreach campaigns and community initiatives simultaneously.
* Interest in housing, urban development, sustainability, or community-driven projects is a strong plus.
* Creative and resourceful — always looking for new ways to engage and connect municipalities and provinces.
* Self-motivated and proactive — you take ownership of your work and are comfortable working independently.
* Passion for purpose-driven work and enthusiasm for CrowdBuilding’s mission.
### **What We Offer**
* **Generous employee stock option plan** — share in the success you help create.
* Opportunity to work at a **steward-owned company**, where purpose and impact come first.
* Work alongside a **diverse, mission-driven team** passionate about solving the housing crisis.
* **Free lunch, snacks, and drinks** at our Amsterdam office.
* **Commuting allowance** to support your commute.
* Professional development opportunities to **grow your skills** in outreach, community building, and public sector engagement.
* The chance to **shape a new role** and make a meaningful impact on the housing sector at the **municipal and provincial level**.
*We are an equal opportunity employer committed to building a diverse team where everyone feels welcome. We do not discriminate based on race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, age, mental or physical ability, or any other aspect of identity. We strongly believe that diversity contributes to a more successful company.*
